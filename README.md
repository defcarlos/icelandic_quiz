# icelandic_quiz
This is a simple python script that quizes the user on icelandic terms or phrases.
The terms and phrases are in a JSON file in the same folder.
In the future I'll be adding more terms to the current file as well as additional files.
I'll also be working on implementing some improvements to the code such as the ability to choose a module to load.
